# Script to run examples from README.md file
# Usage: ./scripts/run-examples-from-readme.sh
#
# This script will run all the commands from README.md file and check if they pass or fail.
# If any command fails, it will print the command and exit with non-zero status.
# If all commands pass, it will remove the log file and exit with zero status.
#
# Note: This script assumes that the iggy-server is not running and will start it in the background.
#       It will wait until the server is started before running the commands.
#       It will also terminate the server after running all the commands.
#       Script executes every command in README.md which is enclosed in backticks (`) and and start
#       with `cargo r --bin iggy -- `. Other commands are ignored. Order of commands in README.md
#       is important as script will execute them from top to bottom.
